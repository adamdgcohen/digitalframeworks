# A report from *The Guardian* on the practice of shackling inmates during childbirth

Late last month, *The Guardian* ran [a piece](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/north-carolina-ends-shackling-of-inmates-during-childbirth) about a new policy that restricts North Carolina prisons from shackling inmates who are in labor. The legislation allows women to give birth free from wrist, waist, and leg restraints “unless she poses an immediate risk of escape or is a clear threat to herself or others.” North Carolina is now one of 19 states prohibiting the practice.

The data component of the story is fairly basic – it consists of one visualization, below which the author provides clear source information. The U.S. map highlights the eight states that do not restrict shackling in any way. It left me wondering where the other 42 states fall on the spectrum. I like the idea of using a map, but I thought the author could have made use of a color-coded system to show:

1. the 19 states that have legislation in place prohibiting or restricting shackling,
2. the eight states that have no policies on the subject,
3. and the remaining states, which have some restrictive policies in place, but no law forbidding shackling.

If the author were inclined to add another layer of data to the visualization, she could include the number of pregnant incarcerated women in each state.

Overall, the piece was well written and easy to understand. It was a straight news story that expanded its scope to include nationwide policies on shackling. I think adding a bit more detail to the map could add a lot to the reader’s comprehension of the topic.
