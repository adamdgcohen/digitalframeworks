# Green Energy's Place in Blue and Red States

One of the Donald Trump's main talking points during his presidential campaign had to do with domestic energy production, a topic that has become a hot-button issue in most political debates. Trump pledged to promote "clean coal" and other traditional energy production methods based on fossil fuel. And this fits in with our most basic ideas about the energy debate: It would seem that liberals favor the expansion of renewables and conservatives favor emissions-producing technologies.

The [United States Wind Turbine Database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/), a joint venture between the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the American Wind Energy Association, muddles this assumption. Often motivated by economic opportunity, rather than moral reasoning, many republicans are contributing to the growth of the wind energy industry.

In fact, of the 3,662 wind turbines built since January 2017, 2,902 are in states that voted for Trump. Texas alone has built 1,352. Regardless of politics, Oklahoma, Kansas, and other wind-swept Midwestern states will continue will continue to rev up renewable production in the years to come.
