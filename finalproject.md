# **'Of Outstanding Universal Value'**

Begin your tour in Venice, bouncing between the 118 small islands that rise up out of the Adriatic Sea on Italy’s northeastern coast. As you walk around, be sure to look up, so as not to miss the innumerable examples of Venetian Gothic and rococo architecture. If traversing each of the city’s 400 bridges begins to wear you out, sit and sip a caffè in Piazza San Marco, within view of St. Mark’s Basilica and its breathtaking Byzantine mosaics.

When you have had enough of the gondola rides in Europe’s largest car-free urban area, leave the city and rent a car. Drive three hours north into the Italian Alps. Soon, you will be in the Dolomites, a mountain range known for its vertical walls, sheer cliffs, and dramatic valleys. Spend a few days hiking the region’s 18 awe-inspiring peaks.

Venice and the Dolomites are two World Heritage Sites, as designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). “To be included on the World Heritage List,” UNESCO states, “sites must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one out of [ten selection criteria](http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/).” In all, there are [1,073 sites](http://whc.unesco.org/en/syndication): 832 of cultural importance, 206 of natural importance, and 35 of both.

The Venice-to-Dolomites itinerary gives you a chance to see two sites that are geographically close, but distinct in their significance to humanity. Venice falls under the rarest cultural criterion, in that it is “an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change.” Only 14 percent of the World Heritage Sites qualify under this category. Likewise, the Dolomites are one of the 8 percent of sites that fall under the rarest natural category: “to be outstanding examples representing major stages of earth's history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features.”

The World Heritage Program began in 1972, when the General Conference of UNESCO adopted the *Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage*. Since then, the program has been incredibly well received, with 193 state parties ratifying the convention and 167 of them receiving sites.

Despite this popularity, critics say that World Heritage Committee has not done enough to recognize significant landmarks outside of Europe. Indeed, the Europe and North America region contains 506, or 47 percent, of the world’s total sites. Asia and the Pacific boasts 253 sites (24 percent of the total), while the remaining three regions—Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and the Arab States—contain only 314 sites (30 percent of the total) combined.

Italy, in fact, is home to more World Heritage Sites than any other nation in the world. You could see Venice, the Dolomites, and 51 other sites without crossing an international border. If you wanted to extend your trip from there but stay in the nearby Western European countries of Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, you could see a whopping 215 sites—one-fifth of the world’s total.

Seven of the 10 most well endowed nations belong to Europe and North America, but it is not the only region worth visiting. China, for example, has 52 sites, the second-most of any country, and four of its sites are of mixed cultural and natural significance. Australia also boasts four mixed sites, as well as the Great Barrier Reef: at nearly 35 million hectares, the third-largest site in the world. (The four largest sites are all marine or island habitats.)

To see two of the four most expansive terrestrial sites, make your way to Africa. Niger’s Aïr and Ténéré National Nature Reserve covers 7.7 million hectares and is home to “an outstanding variety of landscapes, plant species and wild animals.” Tassili n'Ajjer, close behind Aïr and Ténéré in size, at 7.2 million hectares, is located on a vast plateau in the Sahara of southeast Algeria. In addition to being a “strange lunar landscape of great geological interest,” the site contains more than 15,000 pieces of prehistoric cave art, which “record the climatic changes, the animal migrations and the evolution of human life on the edge of the Sahara from 6000 BC to the first centuries of the present era.”
