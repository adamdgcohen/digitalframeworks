# Donors to the President's Reelection Campaign May Not Realize Where Some of Their Money is Going: Into Trump's Pocket

As soon as Donald Trump took his presidential oath last January, a committee called Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., began working on his 2020 reelection campaign. A new Medill News Service analysis of data collected by the Federal Election Commission over the past year shows that Trump’s reelection campaign committee has also been working tirelessly toward another goal: enriching the president himself.

Between January 9, 2017 and March 30, 2018, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. received a total of $25,981,705.73 from fundraising committees. The legal structure of these entities, which have names like the Trump Victory Committee and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, allows donors to give up to $449,400—far higher than the $2,700 cap set on direct donations to the reelection campaign.

In same time frame, the campaign has paid $836,923.56 for expenses including lodging, facility rental, catering services, legal consulting, and office supplies. Every dollar spent has gone to businesses in which the president has a vested interest: the Trump International Hotels in Washington and Las Vegas, Trump Tower Commercial LLC, Trump Restaurants LLC, Trump Plaza LLC, the Trump Corporation, and more.

In effect, after laundering the money through a number of fundraising committees, President Trump is using reelection campaign donations to advance his own business interests. This practice lends credence to the widespread belief that the president’s unprecedented decision not to divest from his corporations before taking office is ethically untenable.
