# What Do Jersey Norms Say About the Changing Nature of the NBA?

In recent years, the NBA has upended its tradition of having home teams wear light-colored (usually white) jerseys and having away teams wear dark-colored ones. First came “alternate uniforms”—in Chicago, these were black jerseys thrown in occasionally in place of the home whites and road reds. Starting in 2012, the team began wearing red “Los Bulls” tops in honor of the League’s Noche Latina. Since then, there have been Nike “City Edition” uniforms, and many teams have even thrown the concept of wearing white at home and colors on the road out the window. I propose that we track the following variables, as a way of keeping tabs on increasing gimmickry and commercialism in the NBA:

* Date the game was played
* Jersey worn by the team being tracked
* Opponent
* Whether it was home or away game for the team being tracked
* Whether the game was nationally broadcast

I will collect the data using [ESPN's game recaps](http://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=400975785).

Let's say that we had been tracking the Chicago Bulls over the last several seasons. Here is what a few entries in the database would look like:

Date | Jersey Worn | Opponent | Home/Away | National TV
---- | ----------- | -------- | --------- | -----------
2012/03/12 | Los Bulls | New York Knicks | Home | Yes (ESPN)
2012/03/19 | Los Bulls | Orlando Magic | Away | Yes (TNT)
2018/01/26 | City Edition | Los Angeles Lakers | Home | No
2018/04/11 | City Edition | Detroit Pistons | Home | No
2018/04/09 | White | Brooklyn Nets | Away | No
2018/04/06 | Black | Boston Celtics | Away | No
2018/03/17 | Red | Cleveland Cavaliers | Home | No
